 <li>Show that the running time of the merge-sort algorithm on n​ ​-element sequence is    <em>O</em>(<em>n</em> <em>log</em> <em>n</em>),even when <sup>n</sup>​ ​ is not a power of 2.</li>

 <li>Consider a modification of the deterministic version of the quick-sort algorithm where we choose the element at index ⌊<em>n</em>/2⌋ as our pivot. Describe the kind of sequence that would cause this version of quick-sort to run in Ω(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) 3. Describe and analyze an efficient method for removing all duplicates from a collection A​ ​ of n​ ​ elements.</li>

 <li>Given an array A of n integers in the range [0, n​<sup>2 </sup>-​ 1], describe a simple method for sorting A in <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</li>

 <li>Show that quicksort’s best-case running time is Ω(<em>n</em> <em>log</em> <em>n</em>).</li>
